# nvim

My personal Neovim configuration to enhance editing productivity.

## Requirements

Make sure you have these installed:

```bash
brew install neovim ripgrep
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelewaldo/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```

Open Neovim to automatically install plugins and start using the config.
